## 📝 Program Overview

This program provides comprehensive training on designing a complete SoC, from RTL design to final GDSII layout, utilizing open-source EDA tools. As a participant in India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, this journey contributes to building real silicon and strengthening the nation's semiconductor ecosystem.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
* Mastering the full RTL-to-GDSII design flow.
* Utilizing open-source tools for synthesis, simulation, and physical design.
* Contributing to a large-scale, hands-on RISC-V tapeout project.
